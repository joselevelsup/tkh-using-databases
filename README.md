# Databasing Practice

## Setup

1. Clone or Fork this repo
2. `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install`
3. Setup MongoDB Atlas and PlanetScale for cloud databases (we will be using these services instead of installing locally)
   1. If you don't have an account, signup using your github account
   2. We will create a free database so you won't get charged
4. Once it's all setup, we will add the urls to their respective files to see the orm/odm in action
5. We will go over prisma together
